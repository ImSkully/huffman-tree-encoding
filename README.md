# Huffman Tree Text Compression
A text encoder and decoder based on huffman text compression. The output from the Huffman algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol *(such as a character in a file)*. The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
